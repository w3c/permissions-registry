      <p>
        This registry lists the [=powerful features=] being standardized for the web platform. It
        provides a centralized place to find these features. However, this does not imply that
        [=user agent=] will support every feature. Specifications adding new features to the web
        platform should add them to this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the list of features is not exhaustive. It is expected that new features will be
        added to this document as they are implemented.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title="Specifying a powerful feature">
        Please refer to the [[[Permissions]]] specification for guidance on how to specify a
        powerful feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        [=Powerful features=] are identified by a unique string token, which is used for
        integration with the [[[Permissions]]] and [[[Permissions-Policy]]].
      </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>
          Not all permission policy tokens are powerful features (e.g., "sync-xhr"), but every
          [=powerful feature=] is a [=policy-controlled feature=].
