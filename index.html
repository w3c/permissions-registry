        This document serves as the [=W3C registry=] of [=permissions=] of the web platform, which
        includes both [=policy-controlled features=] and [=powerful features=].

    <section id="sotd">
      <p>
        The list of features in this registry is not exhaustive. It is expected that new features
        will be added to this document as they are implemented across multiple user agents.

      <h2>
        Purpose
      </h2>
      <p>
        This [=W3C Registry=] provides a centralized place to find the [=policy-controlled
        features=] and/or [=powerful features=] of the web platform. Through the [=change process=]
        it also helps assure permissions in the platform are consistently specified across various
        specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        By splitting the registry into standardized permissions and provisional permissions, the
        registry also provides a way to track the status of these features.

      <h2>
        Change Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn>change process</dfn> for adding and/or updating this registry is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If necessary, add a "Permissions Policy" section to your specification which includes
        the following:
          <ol>
            <li>The string that identifies the policy controlled feature (e.g., `"super-awesome"`).
            Make sure the string is linkable by wrapping it a [^dfn^] element.
            </li>
            <li>The [=default allowlist=] value (e.g. `'self'`).
              <aside class="example" title="Specifying a Permissions Policy">
                <p>
                  An typical example that would meet this criteria:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  The Super Awesome API defines a [=policy-controlled feature=] identified by the
                  string "super-awesome". Its [=default allowlist=] is `'self'`.
                </blockquote>
              </aside>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Determine if your feature meets the definition of a [=powerful feature=] (i.e.,
        requires [=express permission=] to be used). If it does:
          <ol>
            <li>[=Specifies a powerful feature|Specify a powerful feature=] in your specification
            in conformance with the [[[Permissions]]] specification.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Modify either the [=table of standardized permissions=] or the [=table of provisional
        permissions=] filling out each column with the required information.
        </li>
        <li>Submit a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/permissions/">Powerful
        Features Registry Repository</a> on GitHub with your changes. The maintainers of the
        repository will review your pull request and check that everything integrates properly.

      <h2>
        Registry table of standardized permissions
      </h2>
      <p>
        For a permission to appear in the table of standardized permissions, and thus be considered
        a <dfn>standardized permission</dfn>, it needs to meet the following criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented and demonstrably interoperable in at least two browser engines (e.g., has
        accompanying <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org">Web Platform Tests</a>).
        </li>
        <li>Is specified in published as [=technical report=] by a W3C [=Working Group=] with
        maturity of [=first public working draft=] or above, or is published by the <a href=
        "https://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a> as a standard.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each [=permission=] is identified by a unique literal string. In the case of
        [[[Permissions-Policy]]], the string identifies a [=policy-controlled features=].
        Similarly, in the [[[Permissions]]] specification the string identifies a [=powerful
        feature=].
      </p>
      <aside class="note" title="Permissions and Permissions Policy">
        <p>
          Not every [=policy-controlled feature=] is [=powerful features=]. For example,
          "web-share" is a [=policy-controlled feature=] that is not classified as a [=powerful
          feature=] because it doesn't require [=express permission=] to be used. However, with
          very few exceptions, most [=powerful features=] are also [=policy-controlled features=].
          For example, "geolocation" is both a [=policy-controlled feature=] and a [=powerful
          feature=], as it requires [=express permission=] to be used. Please refer to the
          [[[Permissions]]] specification for guidance on how to [=specifies a powerful
          feature|specify a powerful feature=].
